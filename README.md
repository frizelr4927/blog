# Best Laptop brands for students at St Paul's College.

I conducted a survey on a group of 10 students at St Paul's College, this survey was to find out two things, the brand of laptop that a student is using, and their satisfaction of the laptop. 

I found that:

Lenovo was the most popular brand, followed by HP and Microsoft Surface

Something that I found was that the most popular brands did not have the highest satisfaction rates, rather the lesser-known brands or lesser-used brands had the larger amount  of satisfaction.

## Lenovo
Lenovo was most popular, but had about 60% satisfaction. This could indicate that they make good laptops, but have a few issues that students might need to work out to use them to their max potential.

## HP
HP was the second most popular, but had the least satisfied users, at a low 20% satisfaction, this could indicate that HP makes very cheap laptops which look very good on paper but in real life are not that good.

## Microsoft Surface
Microsoft Surface laptops were the least popular brand that they responded with, they had the most satisfied users, at 100% satisfaction. This could mean that they are really good laptops, but are expensive, which is why there is less users, but very high satisfaction.

## Macbooks and Dell
Apple Macbooks, and Dell were the options that were not responded to, I assume this is due to small survey size, as there are people that I know that do use macbooks and dell devices. 

## Conclusion

What laptop you buy depends on two factors, budget and what you want to be able to do with it.
If you want to save on money, go with Lenovo, as they had fairly satisfied users but still at a reasonable price. HP, while cheaper, had very unsatisfied users, and you'd be wasting money risking buying a cheap HP. If you have the budget however, buy a Microsoft Surface, they have highly satisfied customers and can do a bit more than what the Lenovo laptops can.
