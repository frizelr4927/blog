# Best Laptop brands for students at St Paul's College.

I conducted a survey on a group of 10 students at St Paul's College, this survey was to find out two things, the brand of laptop that a student is using, and their satisfaction of the laptop. 

I found that:

Lenovo was the most popular brand, followed by HP and Microsoft Surface
 Something that I found was that the most popular brands did not have the highest satisfaction rates, rather the lesser-known brands or lesser-used brands had the larger amount  of satisfaction.

## Lenovo
Lenovo was most popular, but had about 60% satisfaction. This could indicate that they make good laptops, but have a few issues that students might need to work out to use them to their max potential.

## HP
HP was the second most popular, but had the least satisfied users, at a low 20% satisfaction, this could indicate that HP makes very cheap laptops which look very good on paper but in real life are not that good.

## Microsoft Surface
Microsoft Surface laptops were the least popular brand that they responded with, they had the most satisfied users, at 100% satisfaction. This could mean that they are really good laptops, but are expensive, which is why there is less users, but very high satisfaction.

## Macbooks and Dell
Apple Macbooks, and Dell were the options that were not responded to, I assume this is due to small survey size, as there are people that I know that do use macbooks and dell devices.
